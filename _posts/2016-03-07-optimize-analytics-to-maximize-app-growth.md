description: "Any publisher worth his cyber salt can pump out an app, but relying on a 'build it and they will come' mobile mentality, without measuring key metrics and scrutinizing user data during and after the launch, is a significantly flawed strategy. To remain competitive and keep your app audience happy, analytics are the answer, say the experts."
